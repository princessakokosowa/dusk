# dusk

This repository is basically me playing with WebGPU and making use of some cool wrappers around it written in Zig. I'd like to see what this API is capable of and how easy it is to use it. _dusk_ because Google Chrome's WebGPU implementation is called _Dawn_ and I thought this would be a good name.
